Story:
    It was well past midnight, kid Lumina was deep in her sleep, for she just
finished checking the horses, and the moon reflecting light onto her tiny face
filled with tenderness. It was after 3 days she had had just a good meal. She 
never got to know her parents for they had passed away in a accident when she 
was 2 days old. Her current employer did not give her enough to have a good
meal, but she couldn't care, she loved being with the horses.

A sudden noise woke her up, she went out to check the source of the noise only
to see something she never imagined she would see....


Style:
    After the prologue, Lumina undergoes a change withing herself that 
    encourages to be a leader and then proceeds to free the country from
    Brutus' unforgiving wrath.

    to increase the chances of freeing Rome.
